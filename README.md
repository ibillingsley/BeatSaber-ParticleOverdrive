# Particle Overdrive
Particle Overdrive is a mod for Beat Saber that lets you customize the game's many particle effects.

* Plugin made by [lolPants](https://github.com/luludotdev/BeatSaber-ParticleOverdrive)
* BSIPA conversion by [Steven ðŸŽ€](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten)
* Additional contributions by [Zingabopp](https://github.com/Zingabopp), [Shadnix](https://github.com/Shadnix-was-taken/BeatSaber-ParticleOverdrive), and [Kaitlyn](https://github.com/irlbunny/BeatSaber-ParticleOverdrive)

## Manual Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> In addition to BSIPA, you must have [BS Utils](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/Beat-Saber-Utils), [SiraUtil](https://github.com/Auros/SiraUtil), and [BeatSaberMarkupLanguage](https://github.com/monkeymanboy/BeatSaberMarkupLanguage) installed for this mod to load. Install them using your mod manager i.e. [BSManager](https://bsmg.wiki/pc-modding.html#bsmanager).

Place the contents of the unzipped folder from the latest [release](https://github.com/qqrz997/BeatSaber-ParticleOverdrive/releases/latest) into your Beat Saber installation folder. If you need more information regarding manual installation of mods [this wiki page](https://bsmg.wiki/pc-modding.html#manual-installation) will help. For further help with installing mods, join the [Beat Saber Modding Group](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) discord server.

Older versions of ParticleOverdrive are not supported. If you find issues using an older version then I won't be able to help.

## Known Issues/Mod Interactions
* Interactions with Tweaks55: If you have Particle Overdrive and Tweaks55 installed at the same time, expect the following behaviour:

  * Disabling any particle sources in Tweaks55 (such as wall clash or saber clash) will disable the corresponding particles and overwrite any Particle Overdrive settings for those particles
